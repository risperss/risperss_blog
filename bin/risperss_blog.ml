(* We're almost done! Now that we have a function that "builds" our blog, all we
   need to do is pass it to a Runtime for it to execute "concretely." It's as
   simple as that. We allow the user to choose whether they just want to build
   the site or serve it statically. The code to manage the CLI is a bit adhoc :P
   but is only present as an example :)*)

(* And there you have it, our blog is now finished. To be able to build your
   site from scratch, with even more flexibility, we invite you to read through
   the various templates to understand how we interact with the blog's UI, and
   of course, the Archetype module to understand how to create your own data
   models! (However, be warned, the Archetype module is a bit dense, to allow by
   default for handling a wide range of "classic" use cases when building a
   blog.) *)
